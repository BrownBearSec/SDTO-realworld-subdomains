# SDTO-realworld-subdomains

A repository to host the subdomain wordlists from my blog "What I learnt from reading 217 subdomain takeover bug reports"

https://medium.com/@nynan/what-i-learnt-from-reading-217-subdomain-takeover-bug-reports-c0b94eda4366


There are four wordlists:
- internal.txt
- external.txt
- ambiguous.txt
- combined.txt

---

1) **internal.txt** contains all subdomains which were observed to be vulnerable and looked like they were intended to be internal.

2) **external.txt** contains all subdomains which were observed to be vulnerable and looked like they were intended to be used for public facing assets.

3) **ambiguous.txt** contains all subdomains which were observed to be vulnerable and I could not tell there purpose.

4) **combined.txt** is a file containing all of the above subdomains.
